# Clean Food Accessibility & Price Intelligence  
### Geospatial Analytics Project (Whitefield, Bengaluru)

## Overview
This project is a **geospatial data analytics system** designed to evaluate **clean food accessibility and affordability** across urban zones using spatial joins, distance modeling, and location-based aggregation.

The Phase-1 implementation focuses on **Whitefield, Bengaluru**, while the system architecture is intentionally designed to be **scalable across cities, zones, and domains** with minimal code changes.

---

## Objectives
- Quantify **physical accessibility** to clean food outlets
- Analyze **price distribution and affordability** by zone
- Identify **underserved areas** using spatial metrics
- Build a **config-driven foundation** that can scale to new geographies

---

## Phase-1
- **Geography:** Whitefield (Bengaluru)
- **Granularity:** BBMP ward-level zones
- **Domain:** Clean food & grocery access
- **Output:** Geospatial analytics dashboard

## Key Metrics (KPIs)
- Nearest clean food store distance (km)
- Store density per 10,000 population
- Average normalized price index
- Composite accessibility score
- Underserved zone classification
